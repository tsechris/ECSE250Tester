# ECSE250Tester
## group initiative to make a better tester
By grouping up our efforts, we believe that we can find more edge cases with less effort.

The goal of this project is that any student can quickly get a trustworthy assessment of the quality of their project.

## quick start
* Clone the repository on your computer.
```git
git clone https://github.com/jubiiz/ECSE250Tester.git
```
* Go into the assignment folder of your choice
* pick the tester of your choice
* copy paste the tester package (folder) (e.g. junitTester) next to your assignmentX package
* run the tests
* enjoy the debugging!!

## contributing
Each tester can have its own guideline, check the specific ```readme.md``` of the tester to which you want to contribute. 
### general guidelines:
* **NO ASSIGNMENT CODE WILL BE TOLERATED** <br>
As per the requirements of this assignment, it is forbidden to share our code. To continue being able to share our tester code, please honor the trust that the TAs are putting in us.

* **Contributions should be polished** <br> We want the tester to be trustworthy and easy to expand. Put effort into what you push. Make your own private tester if you want to write quick spaghetti code.
